- This code snippet sets up an Express.js server to serve a React (or any other front-end) application's static files from a dist folder and ensures that all routes (handled by React Router or similar) are directed to the index.html file.

- Vite : 

    app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '/client/dist')));

- CRA : 

    app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '/client/build')));
