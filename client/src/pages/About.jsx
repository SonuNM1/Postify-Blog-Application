              Welcome to my Blog! Myself Sonu N. Mahto. This blog was created as
              a personal project to share thoughts, ideas, and experiences with
              the world. I have recently completed my Master's in Computer
              Applications (MCA) and have learned various programming languages
              such as JavaScript and Java. With a passion for both frontend and
              backend development, I am currently looking for job
              opportunities in the IT industry as a fresher.

              new skills, and exploring different technologies. The blog serves
              as a platform to share knowledge, insights, and personal growth in
